# summer3proto
This is intended as a scratchpad space for specific internal mechanisms which might become candidates for summer3.
It's not meant to contain end-user code, models, documents, or anything else.

This is _not_ a working release of anything.  Don't pull this and expect to be able to run code (unless you wrote it, and even then that's a maybe!)
